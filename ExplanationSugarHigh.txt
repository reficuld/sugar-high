There are two for-loops, first one goes through all elements in array of candies(shortening it by first element).
Second loop adds indexes to the array of indexes and updates sum.
Also, variable cnt is incremeneted for each added element.
After this i-loop, I check if sum that we got in loop is less than current minSum
and if the number of candies is equal or greater than current max number of candies.
If it is, then I add elements of array of indexes to the main Array. 
In the final step of function sugarHigh,
I shortened output array.(so it only displays for example : 2 3 and not 2 3 0 0 0).
I will add comments to my code, so it's easier to understand it.
